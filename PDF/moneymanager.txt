💰 Money Manager – Full Development Checklist
(React + Spring Boot + MySQL)
This document is a complete, step-by-step development plan describing what the developer has to do
to build the project from scratch.
All generated code was reviewed, modified, tested, and integrated manually.
This project follows the same feature scope and learning objectives as a full-length guided tutorial, but
was implemented independently using a structured plan.
